Basic slab allocator

TODO:
    - Move freelist linkage to the end of free buffers
    - Add constructor and destructor, this requires an extra word in the obj
      buffer
    - Look into huge pages and how they might work for larger objects, i.e. if
      anyting less than 1/8 of a page is small, then the object classification
      is based on the page size
    - Should I use posix_memalign rather than manual alignment and mmap?
    - Do I want to try cache coloring?
    - How does a per-slab free list effect allocation/free time. How does it
      effect reap time
    - Should I validate pointers that are passed to obj_cache_free as part of
      slabs that I've allocated? How does this effect performance
